                                <p> The excitement of taking on new challenges is one of the main motivating
                                    reasonsÂ behind
                                    my
                                    decision to pursue a career in web development. Learning to program is a difficult
                                    task.
                                    However, as they say, "hard effort pays off"! This advice is just as good for a
                                    career
                                    in
                                    web development as it is anywhere else.
                                </p>
                                <p> Okay, I lied, hard work doesn't always pay off, but it does in this circumstance!
                                    Learning
                                    to program is a rewarding endeavor in and of itself. Figuring out difficult concepts
                                    or
                                    activities is a frustrating thrill on its own.</p>

                                <p> The fact that the web development field is so inclusive and diverse is another
                                    reason I
                                    want
                                    to work in it. The field of IT as a whole has proven to be quite inclusive of LGBT
                                    and
                                    neurotypical individuals. </p>
                                <p>It's important to appreciate the opportunity to work in a field where you're
                                    respected.
                                    The
                                    possibility of working in such a supportive environment inspires and motivates me to
                                    reach
                                    my full potential as a web developer.</p>
